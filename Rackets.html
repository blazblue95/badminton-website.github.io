                    A head-heavy racket has more mass towards the head of the racket. These rackets can increase power in the strokes and are suitable for players who like to play a powerful game from the back of the court. This type of racket is especially useful for rallies as they can produce very lengthy clears so it's definitely a weapon for those whose game revolves around long exchanges.

                    A head-light racket, on the other hand, has less weight towards the head of the racket. Hence, it’s much easier to control and swing the racket and are popular among doubles player who needs to react quickly against opponents smashes. This sort of racket is much easier to manipulate and swing, thus reducing reaction time. It also offers a lot more speed at the net and allows you to kill a game in the front court.

                    As the name suggests, an even balance racket is designed to provide the middle ground between a head-heavy and head-light balance racket. If you’re not sure what type of playing style you’re going for, an even balance racket is the most suitable in this instance. If you are just starting out in the game, then this racket will be the perfect one to start with. Once you have established your style of play, you can then transit to the Head-Heavy or Head-Light versions to improve your overall game.
